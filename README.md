## History

Owl was originally developed by Adalid Claure (<aclaure@gmail.com>). The program
was originally released a closed sourced project in 2014. Many of the icons were created by Robert
Burnham (<burntham77@gmail.com>) and the original vBulletin encryptor plugin was written by Joe DiBiasi
(<joedibiasi@gmail.com>).

The source was released on GitHub in January 2016 with the hope that other people would contribute to 
the application and make it better.

Owl is named in the spirit of the popular OSX email client, Sparrow, from which many UX ideas were
taken.
