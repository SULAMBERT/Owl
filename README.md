## History

Owl was originally developed by Adalid Claure (<aclaure@gmail.com>). The program
was originally released a closed sourced project in 2014. Many of the icons were created by Robert
Burnham (<burntham77@gmail.com>) and the original vBulletin encryptor plugin was written by Joe DiBiasi
(<joedibiasi@gmail.com>).

Owl is named in the spirit of the popular OSX email client, Sparrow, from which many UX ideas were
taken.
